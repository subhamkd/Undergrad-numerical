# Undergrad-numerical
These are the various small scripts for solving different types of algebraic equations that I developed during my undergraduate courses as assignments

   ## Gauss_matlab
   Contains matlab programs and scripts to solve n linear equations using Gaussian Elimination or Gauss-Jordan method
   
   ## Chemical_C
   Contains the different C programs written for the CH 501 course at NIT Durgapur. They can be used for the solution of chemical engineering problems involving
   bubble/dew point calculation of a mixture, Flashing of mulitcomponent mixtures, CSTRs, Heat exchangers etc.
